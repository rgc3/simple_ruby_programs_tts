# Write a program that prompts you for a String and then outputs the length of the String.

# My first attempt below

# puts "please enter some text and I will return the length of your string"
#
# string = gets.chomp
#
# def string_length
#	length = string.length
# end
#
# puts string_length


# Solution below
	
puts "please enter some text and I will return the length of your string"

string = gets.chomp

def string_length(x)
	string = "#{x.length}"
	puts length
	
end

string_length(string)
