# Instead of printing the name of the animal, print out the sound they make.
#I tried doing this as a hash but could not figure out to print just the hash values

#Michele's solution to the problem below
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'cow']
sounds = ['meow', 'bark', 'moo']
animals.push(sounds)
puts animals.pop
