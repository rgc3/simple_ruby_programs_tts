# Build a student testing app. 
# The app should have a class of Student and the student should "login" 
# with their email and password before they can take a test. 
# The user should be able to take the test and receive feedback on answers. 
# Their score should be saved and printed at the end of the test. 
# If they score under 60 they should be prompted to take the test again.
