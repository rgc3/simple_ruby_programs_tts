#I did not get this one because I made it more complicated than need to be.
#I thought I needed to put times but really only needed morning, afternoon and evening or night

#below is Bryants solution 
# puts 'What time is it?'
# answer = gets.chomp.to_i
# case answer
# when answer >= 6 && answer <= 11
# 	puts 'Good morning!'
# when answer >= 12 && answer <= 19
# 	puts 'Good afternoon!'
# else 
# 	puts 'Good night!'
# end

#below is Marty's solution
# puts 'What time is it? Please use military time.'
# answer = gets.chomp.to_i
# case answer
# when 0..1200
# 	puts 'Good morning'
# when 1300..1600
# 	puts 'Good morning.'
# else
# 	puts 'Good night.'
# end
